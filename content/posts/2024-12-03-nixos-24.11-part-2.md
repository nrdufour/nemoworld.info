title: NixOS 24.11 Part 2
---

In a previous [post]({{< ref "/posts/2024-11-27-nixos-24.11-part-1.md" >}}), I was upgrading a single machine from NixOS 24.05 to 24.11.

This time, it's:

- 9 raspberry pi 4
- 3 orange pi 5+

They all have different profiles and purposes, but they follow 4 big classes:

- kubernetes workers/controllers
- git/ci/cd server
- nas/s3 server
- secret/CA server

I was expecting more trouble with this round, as there is more complexity (and the orange pis needs a custom kernel).

It turns out it was a breeze. Yay NixOS!

The only thing worth mentioning: samba package settings was refactored completely. But once you port your configuration, you're done. To be precise, if you have anything set up in `services.samba.extraConfig`, it will have to be put in `services.samba.settings` instead and as a nix object (you can convert from `ini` format if I remember).

I was expecting more work but this is it folks :D

Probably time to focus on describing the current cluster next time and some status of the "ungoogling" effort so far.
