title: Ungoogling so far - Part 0
---

One year ago, I [mentioned](/posts/2023/12/04/ungoogling/) the fact that Google was becoming a non reliable service, especially YouTube. At the time, it was waging war against adblockers, to the point that the service wouldn't work unless you wait 5 seconds to go anywhere.

After a year, it's time to summarize what changed on my end to stop using those services and any platforms alike. So it's obviously the famous GAFAM (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft), but it applies to any platforms that could be replaced by self-hosting solutions.

The goal of that post serie, will be to explain each solution (or setbacks) I went through so that others can do the same fairly easily (or not, it's so easy to be attached to something).

This will go in this order:

+ Google: with its myriads of services
+ Apple: this one will be short and simple
+ Facebook: and any other social medias based on a platform rather than a protocol
+ Amazon: both the shopping part and the cloud one
+ Microsoft: mostly the OS than anything else
+ Others: any "walled gardens" or services you could self-host

The funny thing here is: the solution is not always technical, but sometimes just thinking differently about things. I think we all sort of forgot what the web was before those platforms came to be.

It's basically a good way to end this year and welcome the new one. **Onwards**!
