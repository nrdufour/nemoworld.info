title: Successfully trapped!
---

Last friday, we manage to trap our 2 strays!

The poor cats were so hungry...

Those two black cats are pregnant and so we are expecting them to have their kittens around first or second week of April.

We are going to keep them in those traps until the labor starts, then move them to a big box full of soft rags.
