[Halloween Spider project](https://github.com/nrdufour/dropping-spider/) progress:

1. motor going up and down: **check**
2. ultrasonic sonar detecting people: **check**
3. outside case: **check**
4. program directing the whole: **check**

What is left to do: have a good pulley, a good string for the spider and mount that to the door lamp!
