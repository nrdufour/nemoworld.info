title: It has been a while
---

Yes, I realized it has been a while since I wrote anything on this space.

Basically a year ...

So why coming back to it? Well, a lot of people I've been following on the fediverse have been truly an inspiration about it, namely:

+ [@elena@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@_elena) for the fresh and limitless energy of her discovery and exploration of the fediverse
+ [@stefan@stefanbohacek.online](https://stefanbohacek.online/@stefan) for exploring other programming approaches on this space and fun experiments as well
+ [@Daojoan@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@Daojoan) for the deep analysis of the moment and deeply focused way to move past it
+ [@molly0xfff@hachyderm.io](https://hachyderm.io/@molly0xfff) for her awesome help regarding wikipedia and curation

It's also the fact that I'm *deeply* tired of any "traditional" social medias. They don't bring anything anymore (if they were even bringing something in the first place). And I love that the notion of blogroll or simply using RSS in order to curate yourself what you read/watch/listen seems to come back.

Besides, my previous post was all about removing any usage of google and its services, or any usage of closed platforms of any kind.
I'll prepare a separate post regarding that because it seems to be working (not yet perfect), and improving at a faster pace.

So, **thank you** fediverse for everything!
