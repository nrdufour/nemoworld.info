title: The 2022 Refresh
---

After 2 long years of inactivity, I finally put some thoughts on this site again.

It looks like Covid did a number and a change of job as well in the process.

This new version tries to come back to its sources where white background is banished. I used the excellent Xe site (<https://xeiaso.net/>) as guide. It has a nice console feeling and uses zero CSS framework or JS one. In fact, the only JS framework I'm using now is lightbox for photo galleries :-).

{{< image-gallery gallery_dir="/gallery/the_refresh" >}}

Now, it's time to add some fun stuff especially astrophotography and ham radio.
