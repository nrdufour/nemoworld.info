In 2012, I wanted to create a simple device for Halloween: having a spider dropping from the top of the door onto the visitors as they approach it. Then Sandy (the hurricane) came and it has been frozen since then ...

Nonetheless I have made a prototype that is working nicely and using mostly Adafruit components.

I haven't properly archived this project apparently. And it seems lost ...
