Babbler is a very old project of mine. The idea was to create new words based on sets of other words reflecting a given topic. The final word is created in such a way that you have the impression of understanding those topics through the new word.

Each set can have any number of words in it, and each generation will follow a scenario that is specifying the weight of each set you want to use. This technique has been used for a while to create new brands or beverage names.

It's suggested to always adding 20% of bad words (insults and alike) to add a "kick" to the final word ;-).
