Linux Aviation HOWTO is a TLDP document trying to document all (or close to) opensource tools/programs/projects related to the aviation.

I took over the document in 2006 and tried to update it since then.

To be honest, I need to update it because no update has been added for quite a while.

I don't intend to update it, so if you want to take it over, feel free to contact me nrdufour at gmail.com.
