EmbryoSys is an old project in which I wanted to implement the whole system studied in the L.I.S.T. departement in the university Paris VI. This system was a great way to study important concepts in modern system, and designed by its director: François Bouillé.

So far, my idea is mostly to document it first. I'll see on the impl later on.
