Ungoogling is the project to get rid of the GAFAM (Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft) and any platforms and using the following principles:

+ priviledge standards & protocols over platforms
+ self-hosting as much as possible but don't be afraid of using others servers/services
+ participate, if time allows, to projects helping those principles
+ use opensource tools


More to come :-)

Preparing a better way to share the progress.
