title: Capsule Networks
topics: Machine Learning

I've been studying Machine Learning for now a while, and I recently learnt about Capsule Networks after seeing an interview with Geoffrey Hinton by Andrew Ng.

I've found the following articles that are introducing this concept fairly well:

+ Part I: [Intuition](https://medium.com/ai%C2%B3-theory-practice-business/understanding-hintons-capsule-networks-part-i-intuition-b4b559d1159b)
+ Part II: [How Capsules Work](https://medium.com/ai%C2%B3-theory-practice-business/understanding-hintons-capsule-networks-part-ii-how-capsules-work-153b6ade9f66)
+ Part III: [Dynamic Routing Between Capsules](https://medium.com/ai%C2%B3-theory-practice-business/understanding-hintons-capsule-networks-part-iii-dynamic-routing-between-capsules-349f6d30418)
+ Part IV: [CapsNet Architecture](https://medium.com/@pechyonkin/part-iv-capsnet-architecture-6a64422f7dce)

Another very good ref:

And finally, how to play with it with the help of Keras:
