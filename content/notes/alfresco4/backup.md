Another sensitive area for Alfresco: how to properly back it up.

So far the best I've found are those links:

+ <https://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Backup_and_Restore> : reference from 3.x and up
+ <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/replication-howto-mysqldump.html> : very important to take a snapshot in Mysql
+ [Alfresco Backup and Disaster Recovery - White Paper](/documents/Alfresco-Backup-and-Disaster-Recovery-White-Paper.pdf)
