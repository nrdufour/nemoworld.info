title: "First step: gathering"
---

Time to gather all projects and archives I've been working and try to make a nice list in a dedicated <a title="Projects" href="/project/">page</a>.
It's rather amazing to see I was writing Babbler in 2004 and I still remember its simplicity.

So gathering means also archiving as much as I can, maintaining git repositories elsewhere than just github, and backup backup backup!

Exporting this blog as well, even if there is not much at the moment. I haven't put back the old entries in it.

Anyway, this is this kind of momentum I need to keep where the word "archive" is the key one.
