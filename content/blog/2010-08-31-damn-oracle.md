Just a little excerpt from IRC about Java and Oracle:

{{< highlight irc >}}
<RSchulz2> "Thank you for installing the  Java Development Kit Version 7  from Oracle Corporation. "
<CapNemo> "from Oracle corporation" .... is it just me or it gives a nasty back taste !
<pantsman> like reading a bedtime story to your kids and then finding out it was written by a paedophile
{{< / highlight >}}

I would say no more ;)
