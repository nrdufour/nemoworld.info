title: "It's time to start archiving"
---

Perhaps it's time to come back to <strong>archiving</strong> as much as I can, andÂ curate information, rather than just letting it go down the drain.
Even if the notes are raw, even if it's just text, links, I'm getting tired of loosing good information.

This site and a few <a href="http://github.com/nrdufour">git repositories</a> should do the trick (and a good backup system).

So onwards!
